This project uses a custom-trained YOLO model to detect concealed handguns in thermal images.

Features
- Identifies presence of handguns in thermal photos
- Outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Saves predictions as annotated images and text files
- Built on a custom YOLO architecture
- Trained on a publicly available thermal dataset
